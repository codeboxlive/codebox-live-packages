# Codebox Live Projects

This SDK is the Window Messaging Hub implementation for use in the Codebox Live web application.

If you are looking to use the Codebox Live extensions in your sandbox application, see [@codeboxlive/extensions-core](../extensions-core/README.md).

If you want to implement your own Window Messaging Hub completely decoupled from Codebox Live, see [@codeboxlive/window-messaging](../window-messaging/README.md).

## Installing the package

### npm

```bash
npm install @codeboxlive/project-client
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add @codeboxlive/project-client
