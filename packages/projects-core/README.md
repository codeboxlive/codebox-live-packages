# Codebox Live Projects

The Window Gateway Hub implementation for use in the Codebox Live web application.

If you are looking to use the Codebox Live extensions in your sandbox application, see [@codeboxlive/extensions-core](../extensions-core/README.md).

If you want to implement your own `WindowGatewayHub` completely decoupled from Codebox Live, see [@codeboxlive/window-gateway](../window-gateway/README.md).

## Installing the package

### npm

```bash
npm install @codeboxlive/project-client
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add @codeboxlive/project-client
