# Window Gateway SDK

This package is a simple package designed to make window post messages bi-directional using promises, ensuring that the child and parent are using a shared set of interfaces to communicate securely. For it to work, both a parent and child window must implement the `WindowGatewayHub` class in this package.

Use this package for any application, irregardless of whether it uses Codebox Live. For a package more tailored for usage in a Codebox Live sandbox app, see the [@codeboxlive/extensions-core](https://github.com/codeboxlive/codebox-live-packages/tree/main/packages/extensions-core) package.
