# Uncle: Codebox Live Application Gateway

Uncle implements the gateway hub for use in the Codebox Live web application.

If you are looking to use the Codebox Live extensions in your sandbox application, see [@codeboxlive/extensions-core](https://github.com/codeboxlive/codebox-live-packages/tree/main/packages/extensions-core).

If you want to implement your own `WindowGatewayHub` completely decoupled from Codebox Live, see [@codeboxlive/window-gateway](https://github.com/codeboxlive/codebox-live-packages/tree/main/packages/window-gateway).
